Structure of this test
----------------------

This test case is a bit special because of the big output generated by the
various test cases. Instead of having a single pair of `expected` and `output`
files, we use one pair per test file.

The diffs for each pair is then appended to the main `output` file. So the
`expected` file is empty and should stay empty.

How to fix this test?
---------------------

1. Identify the file that caused the issue by looking at the produced diff
2. Remove the `build/` directory if it exists
3. Run `idris2 --no-color --console-width 0 --ide-mode < inputN > expectedN`
   where `inputN` is the input file loading the file that caused the issue.
